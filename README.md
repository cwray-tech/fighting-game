# Fighting Game

This is a fun project I did [from Chris Codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ). 

It is a two-player fighting game in JavaScript. Most everything is from the tutorial, other than a bit of CSS that I refactored.

## To play
You need two players to play. One will use the arrow keys, and another will use the w, a, d, and space bar to move around and attack. The goal is to attack and kill the other player before they kill you.
